### Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template  
Selecting the right **Kanban template** was challenging because each option had different workflows and automation levels. I chose **Automated Kanban** for its built-in tracking and automation. Customizing the board required adding a **Testing** column for quality assurance and a **Blocked** column to highlight stalled tasks. Setting up automation correctly also took some trial and error.  

### GitHub vs. Other Tools (Trello, Jira)  
Compared to **Trello**, GitHub’s **Kanban board** integrates directly with repositories, making it ideal for developers. However, **Trello is more user-friendly** with flexible customization. **Jira** offers advanced sprint tracking and reporting but is more complex to set up.  
Overall, **GitHub’s Automated Kanban** was the best fit because of its **automation, issue tracking, and seamless GitHub integration**.
