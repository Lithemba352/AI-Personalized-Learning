# SmartLearn: AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform

## Description
An AI-driven platform that personalizes learning experiences by adapting to individual student needs, tracking progress, and providing actionable insights.

## Language and Design Decisions
Java was selected for this project because it aligns well with object-oriented principles and offers robust support for implementing creational design patterns. I personally chose Java because I am more comfortable using it, which made it easier to focus on applying the patterns correctly.

All six major creational patterns were applied using only the classes present in the UML Class Diagram, ensuring a clean, pattern-focused structure. The patterns were separated into individual packages under `creational_patterns/` for clarity and maintainability. Unit testing was done using JUnit 5, and validation was added to the builder pattern to avoid incomplete object construction.
