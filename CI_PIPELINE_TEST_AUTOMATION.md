# Test results 
This snapshot captures the results of the automated test suite run using GitHub Actions and Maven. It ensures code correctness, validates new changes, and prevents regressions by executing unit and integration tests on each push and pull request. The tests are automatically triggered and provide feedback directly in the CI pipeline.
