# Task 3: Reflection

Designing the domain model and class diagram for this AI-personalized learning system was both exciting and challenging. One of the main challenges I faced was deciding how detailed the class diagram should be. I had to balance between keeping it simple and making sure it captured all essential elements of the system. For example, deciding whether to represent `LearningProgress` as part of `Enrollment` or as a separate class took some thought. I eventually chose to separate it to make the model more scalable and to support advanced AI tracking in future iterations.

Another difficulty was identifying the correct relationships and multiplicity. In some cases, it was tempting to connect everything directly to `User`, but that would have made the diagram too complex and hard to maintain. Instead, I used association classes like `Enrollment` to connect `User` and `Course`, which helped reduce complexity and made it easier to include additional details like `enrolledDate` and `status`.

Designing with AI in mind was a new experience for me. I had to think about how the `AIEngine` would interact with data like learning progress, and how it would generate content recommendations. This required me to introduce a dedicated `Recommendation` class that could be generated based on progress, viewed by the user, and connected to learning content. Including `AIEngine` as a logic unit made it easier to visualize how personalization would work in a real-world system. I also made sure that content entities could carry metadata such as difficulty, tags, and type — these are crucial for filtering and recommending relevant materials.

This class diagram aligns well with previous assignments. For example, in Assignment 8, the state diagram for `User Account` matched the methods in the `User` class like `login()` and `logout()`. The activity workflows like course enrollment and progress tracking directly reflect the roles of `Enrollment` and `LearningProgress` classes in the diagram. Similarly, the domain model from Task 1 provided a solid foundation for identifying key entities and their relationships.

One design trade-off I made was to avoid using inheritance, even though it might have made sense to create subclasses like `Student` and `Instructor` under `User`. Instead, I opted to use a `role` attribute. This simplified the model while still allowing for role-specific logic in the application layer. Another trade-off was keeping methods in each class to just the essential ones for clarity, even though more methods would exist in a full system. I wanted to keep the diagram understandable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Through this process, I learned that object-oriented design is not just about coding structure—it’s about how the system communicates internally. Every class and relationship must reflect a real interaction in the system. I also realized the importance of traceability—being able to link the class diagram back to use cases, functional requirements, and behavioral diagrams ensures consistency and helps identify any gaps.

In conclusion, this assignment deepened my understanding of how to model complex systems. It improved my ability to think logically about structure, behavior, and flow, especially in systems where AI plays a role in personalizing user experiences. I now feel more confident about designing scalable and maintainable systems using UML principles. This project helped me see how powerful a clear design can be in supporting both development and communication within a team.
