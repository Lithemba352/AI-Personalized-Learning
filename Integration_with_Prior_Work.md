# Integration with Prior Work
- The User Registration and Course Enrollment workflows align with the Multi-Device Compatibility and LMS & API Integration requirements.
- Tracking Learning Progress and Assessing Quiz Submissions are tied to the Gamification Features requirement.
- The sprint tasks, such as Allow User Login and Enroll Courses, map to these workflows, ensuring that system features meet both functional criteria and user story goals.
