## GitHub Project Template Comparison

| Template          | Columns & Workflow                     | Automation Features                | Agile Suitability                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**  | To Do, In Progress, Done           | No automation                     | Suitable for simple task tracking         |
| **Automated Kanban** | To Do, In Progress, Done (Auto)   | Auto-moving issues, auto-closing  | Great for sprint tracking and backlog     |
| **Bug Triage**    | Triage, In Progress, Closed         | Auto-labeling issues              | Best for bug tracking and maintenance     |

## **Justification for Choosing Automated Kanban**
I selected **Automated Kanban** because:
It enhances Agile workflows with a built-in-automation that moves issues on all parts of the columnsaccording to their status. I belive that this template ensures efficient sprint tracking and backlog management.
