# Reflection
Choosing the right granularity for states and actions is challenging because too much detail can clutter the diagram, while too little can leave out important steps. For example, the **"Verify Email"** step in the User Registration workflow could be broken into smaller actions, but doing so would have made the diagram harder to read.
Aligning activity diagrams with Agile user stories can be difficult because the workflow must align with both functional goals and technical constraints. In the Content Recommendation workflow, we had to consider scenarios like insufficient data, which could have led to confusion if not handled.
State diagrams focus on an object's behavior over time, while activity diagrams focus on process flows. For example, the User Registration and Course Enrollment workflows are better suited as activity diagrams because they describe tasks and decisions, whereas state diagrams would be better for modeling user status changes, like **"Verified"** or **"Active."**
